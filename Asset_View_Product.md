Problem Statement:

Represent below problem in a high level design diagram.

- Have a set of 250 users.
- Each user has at least one account with assets , i.e. assets can be stocks or mutual
  funds
-  Each user will see his portfolio real time at any time of the day
- Prices come from different sources.
- Design a platform to create, calculate and maintain the portfolios of these users
- Reliably and should scale.
-  The portfolios should be updated as soon as the source provides data for the
   platform.
-  The data gets refreshed every 10 mins.

Solution:

High-Level Design (HLD) Diagram for Portfolio Management Platform Components:

User Management:
- Stores user information (ID, username, password, etc.)
- Manages user accounts and permissions

Asset Management:
- Stores information about different assets (stocks, mutual funds)
- Tracks asset prices and historical data

Portfolio Management:
- Links users to their respective portfolios
- Holds information about each user's assets and their holdings
- Calculates portfolio value and performance metrics

Data Source Integration:
- Connects to various data sources (stock exchanges, financial institutions)
- Ingests and processes real-time price updates

Cache:
- Stores frequently accessed data (e.g., recent asset prices)
- Improves performance and reduces reliance on external data sources

Real-Time Updates:
- Triggers calculations and updates portfolios whenever new data arrives
- Ensures users have the latest information

User Interface:
- Provides users with access to their portfolios
- Displays real-time portfolio value, performance metrics, and individual asset details
- Allows users to view historical data and charts

Data Flow:
- Users interact with the platform through the User Interface.
- User information is retrieved from User Management.
- Portfolio information and asset details are retrieved from Portfolio Management and Asset Management.
- Real-time price updates are received from Data Source Integration and stored in the Cache.
- Portfolio Management triggers calculations and updates portfolios based on new data.
- Updated portfolio information and visualizations are displayed to the user through the User Interface.

Key Considerations:
- Scalability: The platform should be able to handle a growing number of users and assets without performance degradation.
- Reliability: The platform should be highly available and provide consistent real-time updates.
- Security: User data and financial information should be protected with robust security measures.

Additional Information:
- This is a high-level design and specific implementation details may vary.
- The platform can leverage various technologies like microservices, distributed databases, and caching mechanisms for optimal performance and     scalability.
- Real-time updates can be implemented using streaming data pipelines and event-driven architectures.
